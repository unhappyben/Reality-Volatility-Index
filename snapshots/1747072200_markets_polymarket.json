For example, if Romania decides to recertify the results of the November 2024 election, this market would resolve accordingly.\n\nIf the result of this election isn't known by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market group will resolve to \"Other\".\n\nThis market will resolve based on the result of the election as indicated by a consensus of credible reporting.

    "description": "On April 2, 2025, Donald Trump announced a 34% reciprocal tariff on all imports from China, set to take effect on April 9, 2025, at 12:01 a.m. EDT, in addition to an existing 20% tariff (totaling 54%), as part of the “Liberation Day” tariff plan (see: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/04/02/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/).\n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if Donald Trump signs any federal legislation or performs any executive action that lowers, pauses, delays, or removes any tariffs on imports from China by April 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nActions that lower, pause, delay, or remove any tariffs on Chinese imports will qualify, including changes to the 34% reciprocal tariff, the existing 20% tariff, or any other existing or new tariffs specifically targeting Chinese goods.\n\nOnly the removal of tariffs specifically targeting China will qualify. For example, the removal of the 10% general tariff on all imports into the U.S., or a tariff on specific Chinese provinces or entities, will not count toward this market’s resolution.\n\nAny action officially enacted within the market’s time frame will qualify, regardless of when the change goes into effect.\n\nThis market’s primary resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration; however, a consensus of credible information from major news outlets or government statements will also be used.",

    "description": "The first round of the Romanian presidential election, originally held on November 24, 2024, was annulled by the Constitutional Court. On January 16, Romania's coalition government approved a re-run of the presidential election. It is scheduled for May 4, with a second round on May 18, if no candidate receives an absolute majority of the vote (see: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/romania-confirms-date-tightens-rules-presidential-election-rerun-2025-01-16/).\n\nThis market will resolve to the individual who wins the next Romanian presidential election including any potential second round.\n\nThis market is inclusive of any election which results in the selection of the next Romanian President. For example, if Romania decides to recertify the results of the November 2024 election, this market would resolve accordingly.\n\nIf the result of this election isn't known by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market group will resolve to \"Other\".\n\nThis market will resolve based on the result of the election as indicated by a consensus of credible reporting. If there is ambiguity, this market will resolve based solely on the official results as reported by the Romanian Government, specifically the Permanent Electoral Authority (https://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/).\n",
