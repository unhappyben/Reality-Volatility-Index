For example, if Romania decides to recertify the results of the November 2024 election, this market would resolve accordingly.\n\nIf the result of this election isn't known by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market group will resolve to \"Other\".\n\nThis market will resolve based on the result of the election as indicated by a consensus of credible reporting.
