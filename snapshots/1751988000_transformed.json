On January 16, Romania's coalition government approved a re-run of the presidential election. It is scheduled for May 4, with a second round on May 18, if no candidate receives an absolute majority of the vote (see: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/romania-confirms-date-tightens-rules-presidential-election-rerun-2025-01-16/).\n\nThis market will resolve to the individual who wins the next Romanian presidential election including any potential second round.\n\nThis market is inclusive of any election which results in the selection of the next Romanian President. For example, if Romania decides to recertify the results of the November 2024 election, this market would resolve accordingly.\n\nIf the result of this election isn't known by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market group will resolve to \"Other\".\n\nThis market will resolve based on the result of the election as indicated by a consensus of credible reporting. If there is ambiguity, this market will resolve based solely on the official results as reported by the Romanian Government, specifically the Permanent Electoral Authority (https://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/).\n",

For example, if Romania decides to recertify the results of the November 2024 election, this market would resolve accordingly.\n\nIf the result of this election isn't known by December 31, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market group will resolve to \"Other\".\n\nThis market will resolve based on the result of the election as indicated by a consensus of credible reporting.

This could occur via revolution, civil war, military coup, or voluntary abdication, but only qualifies if the Islamic Republic no longer exercises sovereign power.\n\nRoutine political events such as elections, reforms, or leadership succession do not qualify. Internal coups or power shifts that preserve the Islamic Republic’s core structures also do not qualify. Only a clear break in continuity—such as a new provisional government, revolutionary council, or constitution replacing the Islamic Republic will qualify.\n\nPartial loss of territory or challenges from rebel or exile groups will not qualify unless the Islamic Republic no longer administers the majority of the Iranian population within Iran. \n\nThe resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting.
